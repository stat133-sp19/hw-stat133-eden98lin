## Binomial Distribution Functions

The package `"binomial"` implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distriburion, the expected value, variance, etc.

## Creating a binomial random variable

The first step is to create a `"binvar"` object, which is essentially a binomial random variable, with the function `bin_variable(trials, probability)`. This function takes two arguments, which are the number of trials and probablity of success for the binomial distriburion.

```{r}
rand_var <- bin_variable(5, 0.2)
rand_var
```

After the random variable has been created. There is a function to calculate all the binomial measures of the random variable, that is `summary()`. This function only takes a binomial random variable object as argument, returns an object of class `"summary.binvar"` that carrys all the measures.

```{r}
bin_sum <- summary(rand_var)
bin_sum
```

## Functions to get the measures of the binomial distriburion

Beside creating an object and let the summary ouput all the measures at once, you can also find specific value of the measure you want by implementing measure calculation funcitons separately given them appropriate arguments. There are 5 measure calculating functions you can access in this package, that includes:

* `bin_mean()`: calculate the mean of the binomial random variable
* `bin_variance()`: calculate the variance of the binomial random variable
* `bin_mode()`: calculate the mode of the binomial random variable
* `bin_skewness()`: calculate the skewness of the binomial random variable
* `bin_kurtosis()`: calculate the kurtosis of the binomial random variable

Implementing these functions given the arguments `"trials"` and `"prob"`, the value of measure like the ones in the `"Summary Binomial"` will be returned.

## Display the probability distribution of the binomial random variable

Another feature of this package the visual aid of graphing the binomial probability distribution and the cumulative probability distribution using `"plot()"` on an `"bindis"` object.\

But before getting into that, two main function that contribute to making the graphs are `bin_distribution()` and `bin_cumulative()`. `bin_distribution()` will return an object of class `"bindis"` and display the distribution of the binomial random variable, the `bin_cumulative()` has the same feature but return an object of class `"bincum"` and have one more column in its distribution table at the end that indicate the cumulative probabilities.

```{r}
dist1 <- bin_distribution(5, 0.2)
dist1
dist2 <- bin_cumulative(5, 0.2)
dist2
```

## Plot of probability distributions

You can simply apply `plot()` to the variable names that were bound to the distributions to create graphics.

```{r}
plot(dist1)
plot(dist2)
```
